# Chapter 15 - The South and Slavery

## 15-1 "Cotton is King!"
+ Cotton became very profitable in the South
  + More slaves were brought in and more land was purchased to grow more cotton. This resulted in a cycle of profit and reinvestment.
+ Northern shippers also benefited from cotton
  + Loaded cotton at southern ports and sold them to England
  + Used money to buy manufactured good
+ Cotton was very important in America
  + Half of American export value after 1840 was cotton
  + Over half the world's cotton was made in the American South

## 15-2 The Planter "Aristocracy"
+ Rich planters ruled the South
  + They had lots of money, being able to send their children to good schools.
    + Can be seen with men such as John C. Calhoun (Yale Graduate) and Jefferson David (West Point Graduate)
    + Hindered support for tax-supported public education
  + Widened the gap between rich and poor. 
+ Wives of slave owners managed female slaves 
  + Almost no slaveholding women supported abolition

## 15-3 Cotton Capitalism
+ The economic structure in the South became increasingly monopolistic. 
  + As land supply decreased, small farmers sold their land to richer neighbors. 
+ Many plantation owners over-speculated in land and slaves, causing them to fall into debt.
+ Cotton dominance led to a dangerous one-crop economy
  + Diversification of agriculture was discouraged
  + Investment in manufacturing was also discouraged
